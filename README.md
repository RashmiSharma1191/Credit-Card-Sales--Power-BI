# 💳 Credit Card Dashboard — Power BI Project

## 📌 Objective:

To empower stakeholders with a dynamic, real-time credit card dashboard, providing instant access to key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.
The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making and optimize credit card operations through actionable insights.

## 🧾 Data & Source:
- Data sourced from a SQL database containing customer and transaction details.
- Cleaned and transformed using Power Query in Power BI.
- Model built with relationships between customer, transaction, and card details.

## 💡 Actionable Insights & Recommendations
Based on the dashboard analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended:
- Product Focus: Since Blue & Silver cards contribute to 93% of all transactions, dedicated marketing and cross-sell campaigns should target this base for upsell opportunities.
- Resource Allocation: Allocate higher sales and support resources to the TX, NY, and CA markets to capitalize on the 68% revenue concentration.
- Customer Targeting: Investigate conversion rates across gender, as Male customers generate $5M more revenue ($31M) than Female customers ($26M).

## 🧩 Visualization Highlights:
- Dashboard Features: Card KPIs (Revenue, Transactions, Activation & Delinquency Rates), Revenue by Gender, Card Type Contribution, and Transactions by State.
- Design: All visuals were designed in Power BI, utilizing DAX for complex calculations and Power Query for streamlined data ingestion.

## 🧾 Tools Used:
- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization
- SQL Server – Data extraction and integration
- Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

## 🔮 Future Scope
Potential extensions and enhancements for this dashboard include:
- Predictive Analytics: Integrating a forecasting model (e.g., using Python/R within Power BI or SQL) to predict Delinquency Rates or Revenue for the upcoming quarter.
- Customer Segmentation: Implementing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers, allowing marketing teams to create highly targeted retention and upsell campaigns.
- Real-Time Data Flow: Transitioning the data source from scheduled SQL extracts to a live data connection (DirectQuery) for real-time monitoring of transactions and immediate fraud detection alerts.
